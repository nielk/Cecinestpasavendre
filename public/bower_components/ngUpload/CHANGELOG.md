## Update 0.1.1

* ngUpload is now an AngularJS Directive, removing the need to deal with the form[@id] attribute.
* Addition of the __uploadOptionsEnableControls__ option to prevent the default disabling of submission controls during upload, like so:
``` html
<form ng-upload='callbackFunction(contents, completed)' uploadOptionsEnableControls>
   ...
</form>
``` 
_Submission controls are html elements marked with the **upload-submit** css class_.
* Some bug fixes.
